# Detect-Faces-Offline
Uses UWP Windows Face Analysis to check an image for face(s). I used this for processing large batches of files including uploads, so I nested it in a threaded job that processes up to 6 concurrent files. Some functions are split off intoa module file as there was originally a ton more that I've pared back to basics just for the face detection.
